​                               
Who needs to go to sleep when I got /tə/ you next to me?⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 

​                       
All night,   I'll /aɪ.ɪl/        riot /ˈraɪ.ə/       with you/wɪ juː/. 

​                                                             
 know  you /juː/   got   my    back and /bæk ən/   you   know I   got you/ɡɑːtʃɪl/.

So come on, come on, come on.

Let’s get physical！
